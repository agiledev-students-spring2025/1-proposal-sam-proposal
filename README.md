# Project Proposal

## Project Title: Favorite Spots Map

## What and why?

Have you ever visited a city but didn't want to go to all the places flooded with tourists? Have you ever wanted to see places that people personally recommend without having a friend in the city? Introducing you to--Name Pending. This app would be an interactive map for any place on Earth where users would be free to add pins to the map with a title and description of what there is to do at the spot. Users would be able to upvote spots they enjoyed or even comment, creating a living and breathing view of the city, completely fueled by those who visit or inhabit it. No longer will you be worried about finding a restaurant, a viewing vista, or a local bar.

This would act like a social media service where you could follow people and see their spots as well as an explore mode where you can see the most popular spots in the area. There would be ways of putting places into folders that change the colors of the pins and there would be a way to rank your spots.

This alleviates the problem of not knowing what to do when you want to go out on the town. Additionally, it allows you to immerse yourself in the culture and learn what locals like to do for fun. This is important because although google maps exists and shows you everything in a certain area and reviews give you an idea of what you're in for, there's no social aspect to the app. This app is more personally guided and allows for more interaction and personality.

## For whom?

This app would be for a younger audience around ~18-30 who are travelers or want to share the places that they enjoy with their friends/the world. This could be a travelling guru, a college student figuring out what they like in the city, or even a post-grad who is influencing and showing the next coolest spot. Ideally it would involve these people's social networks of young adults showing their spots.

## How?

The main menu would be an interactive map with all of the pins of people you follow on the app. There would also be an "explore page" that would have the most popular spots (possibly curated based on what you and your friends like) and a personal page that has your spots (private or public). There would be a system to make a "pin" which you could either click to place or type in the address. This would then open up a menu to add photos, a description, option to add to folders, etc. There would then be a profile page where you can edit folders that you can use to organize all of your spots. On this page there would be an edit button and an add button to do just those actions for folders. There would be a search tab that you can search for pins or users and you can tab between those two options.

## Scope

This app can be scaled to be as difficult and detailed or as basic as needed to be based on the scrum methodology. The app is robust but only relies on 5 core pages that can have as much or as little functionality as needed. The reliance on less pages allows this project to be adaptable and scalable and should be perfect for 4-6 people to take on over the course of a couple months.
